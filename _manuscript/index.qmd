### Definitions

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 1: Slope"}
The **slope** of the curve $y = f(x)$ at the point $P(x_0, f(x_0))$ is the number

$$
\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h} \quad \text{(provided the limit exists).}
$$

The **tangent line** to the curve at $P$ is the line through $P$ with this slope.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 2: Derivative"}
The **derivative** of a function $f$ at a point $x_0$, denoted $f'(x_0)$, is $$
f'(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + h) - f(x_0)}{h} \quad \text{(provided the limit exists).}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 3: Alternative Derivative"}
$$
f'(x_0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(z) - f(x)}{z-x} \quad \text{(provided the limit exists).}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 4: Theorem 1"}
**Differentiable Implies Continuous** If $f$ has a derivative at $x = c$, then $f$ is continuous at $x = c$.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 5: Derivative of a Constant Function "}
If $f$ has the constant value $f (x)= c$, then $$
\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0.
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 6: Derivative of a positive integer power"}
If $n$ is a positive integer then $$
\frac{dx^n}{dx} = nx^{n-1}.
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 7: Derivative constant multiple rule"}
If $u$ is a differentiable function of $x$, and $c$ is a constant, then $$
\frac{d}{dx}(cu) = c\frac{du}{dx}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 8: Derivative sum rule"}
If $u$ and $v$ are differentiable functions of $x$, then their sum $u + v$ is differentiable at every point where $u$ and $v$ are both differentiable. At such points: $$
\frac{d}{dx}(u + v) = \frac{du}{dx} + \frac{dv}{dx}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 9: Derivative of e"}
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x
$$
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Definition 10: Derivative product rule"}
If $u$ and $v$ are differentiable functions of $x$, then so is their product $u . v$ and

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(u. v) = u\frac{dv}{dx} + v\frac{du}{dx}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Definition 11: Derivative quotient rule"}
If $u$ and $v$ are differentiable functions of $x$ at $v(x)\neq0$, then so is their quotient $u/v$ and

$$
\frac{d\frac{u}{v} }{dx}= \frac{v\frac{du}{dx} - u\frac{dv}{dx}}{v^2}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Definition 12: Derivative sin rule"}
The derivative of the sine function is the cosine function:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(sin x ) = cos(x)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Definition 13: Derivative cosine rule"}
The derivative of the cosine function is the negative of the sine function:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(cos x ) = -sin(x)
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Definition 14: Other important trig rules"}
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dx}(\tan x) &= \sec^2 x \\
\frac{d}{dx}(\cot x) &= -\csc^2 x \\
\frac{d}{dx}(\sec x) &= \sec x \tan x \\
\frac{d}{dx}(\csc x) &= -\csc x \cot x
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Definition 15: The chain rule"}
If $f(u)$ is differentiable at the point $u = g(x)$ and $g(x)$ is differentiable at $x$, then the composite function $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$ is differentiable at $x$, and

$$
(f \circ g)'(x) = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).
$$

In Leibniz's notation, if $y = f(u)$ and $u = g(x)$, then

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx},
$$

where $\frac{dy}{du}$ is evaluated at $u = g(x)$.
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Definition 16: Implicit differentiation"}
1.  Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$, treating $y$ as a differentiable function of $x$.
2.  Collect the terms with $\frac{dy}{dx}$ on one side of the equation and solve for$\frac{dy}{dx}$.
:::

::: {.callout-important title="Definition 17: Dervite rule for inverses"}
If $f$ has an interval $I$ as its domain and $f'(x)$ exists and is never zero on $I$ , then $f^{-1}$ is differentiable at every point in its domain (the range of $f$).

The value of $(f^{-1})'(b)$ at a point $b$ in the domain of $f^{-1}$ is the reciprocal of the value of $f'$ at the point $a = f^{-1}(b)$:

$$
(f^{-1})'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(b))} \tag{1}
$$

or

$$
\frac{d f^{-1}}{dx} \Big|_{x = b} = \frac{1}{\frac{df}{dx} \Big|_{x = f^{-1}(b)}}.
$$
